## Job Composer

The Job Composer is the Open OnDemand clicky button GUI for users not familiar with command line or prefer to use applications outside of Emacs, Vim etc. to edit files. The execution status, templating and other tools will allow laymen users to make basic use of the cluster. For more advanced users, the templating and options available will allow better tracking of multiple job runs and results, and the ability for admins to better assist with problems compared to Apollo2 and SGE.

Exercises:

1. Navigate to the Job Composer. 
    
    Depending on your history on the cluster, you might already see some jobs templates, or other scripts already available.

2. Navigating to Templates

    By default - the navigation bar at the top should have changed colour and show two tabs:
    - Jobs
    - Templates

    These tabs will allow you to switch between Job Templates, which you can create jobs from, and the Jobs editor.

    To navigate back to the Dashboard - click Open OnDemand in the top left.

### Job From Template

In this section the exercises will take you through the job composer and the use of templates to create, edit and submit new jobs.

3. Create a new job.

    From the `New Job` dropdown button - select "From Template". This will navigate you to the "Templates" tab. You can also click the top nav bar.

    Click `Copy Template` - and in the top box - put `/mnt/shared/public/workshops/HPC-Workshop/exercise2/templates/artemis_empty` to copy the template from.

    I will refer to this as `Workshop-Empty` so it might be helpful to name it as such. 

    Click Save.

    In your list now, you should have a new
    Click/Select the `Workshop-Empty` Template - which should show on the right under "Name" column.

1.  Create a New Batch Job
    
    Select your `Workshop-Empty` template, and then Click `Create New Job`.

    You should now be back on the Jobs page instead of templates. with a new job with its details highlighted on the right.

    You should be able to see that the folder contains a single job file, which is empty beside a print statement.

1. Submit a Job

    Run your new job by selecting it in the list of jobs (you might need to use the search bar) and clicking "Submit".

    If the Queue is busy - its will change status to queued.

    It should run almost instantaneously and be marked as Completed.

1. Check Job Results

    Once your job completed, reselect it in the jobs if need be and look at the folder contents.

    Although the job file was mostly empty, Artemis attempted to populate some defaults for you.

    Click the `slurm-<job_id>.out` file and view the results.

    Navigate back to your job page.

1. Editing the Job Script

    Click the `main_job.sh` file to begin editing it.

    Please, either using the <a href="https:artemis-docs.hpc.sussex.ac.uk/artemis">documentation</a>, the slides, google or the cheat sheet, set the SBATCH job headers to complete the following job. 
    
    - `workshops` Partition.
    - Request one CPU.
    - `250mb` of total RAM
    - Explicitly show No Mailing Options
    - Max runtime of 5 minutes
    - One file for stdout and another stderror with the following naming format:
        - `jobname-<jobid>.<out,err>`
    - Outputs the hostname, current working directory and the date on job start.
    - Outputs the jobnumber from the environment variable.
    

    If you get stuck - `/mnt/shared/public/workshops/HPC-Workshop/exercise2/templates/` contains more templates you can view.

    And solutions are the same place but `solutions` instead of `templates`.

    Submit the job to check your results.

6. Changing the Job File

    Open your job script directory using the button in the very bottom right corner.

    Create a new file `my_slurm_job.job` as a copy of `main_job.sh`.

    Now go back to the Jobs Composer, Select your Job, and click `Job Options`.

    This menu will allow you to:
    - Rename your Job
    - Change submit Cluster (You only have artemis available)
    - Change the Job Script Submitted
    - Set the account (if you belong to multiple schools or specific research groups)
    - Set the array args
    - Copy your submit environment

    Please switch the job script to `my_slurm_job.job` and set the array arg to `1-4:2%1`.

    Save your changes and edit your job to also output the Min, Max and Current task number to stdout. 

    You should notice that you now have `Job Array Request:` as a new field when viewing the job.

    Submit the job and check it ran successfully.

### Convert Templates

This section you will create jobs from default templates and attempt to repair/convert them, or design them from scratch. Each exercise will have a number of errors and a description of what the template was meant to do. 

Each Exercise should start by you creating a new job from the template (path: `/mnt/shared/public/workshops/HPC-Workshop/exercise2/templates/`), copying the default job script into a new script and correcting issues.

8. SLURM SMP

    - Template: `slurm_openmp`
    - Description:
        A simple multithread python execution

1. SLURM MPI

    - Template: `slurm_mpi`
    - Description: A Simple 2 proc MPI job.


1. No Route
    
    - Template: `slurm_wget`
    - Description: A simple Job to fetch some files from the web.

        <details>

        <summary>Hint</summary>

            wget -e use_proxy=on -e https_proxy=$HTTPS_PROXY

        </details>

1. Slurm Arrays
    - Template: `slurm_array`
    - Description: A simple use of slurm array syntax. This is a MUST for good "HPC Citizen" behaviour on the cluster. If you need more than 10 jobs of the same type, use an array job to pull the args from a file to run. You'll also learn how to limit concurrency so that your array jobs don't abuse the schedular... 

1. Convert an inherited Apollo2 script

    - Template: `slurm_bugged`
    - Description: This script is already in SLURM format - however there are a number of errors which will prevent it from running, which are mistakes likely to be made when intitally switching from SGE to SLURM; as well as some simple errors we often see. This script should load a non default Python version and then attempt to install to you `workdir` the python module `numpy`.


1. Using GPUs
    - Template: `slurm_gpu`
    - Description: A simple slurm script which will attach a GPU to your job for use with nvidia commands and GPU based workloads. This will give you the basics of connecting a GPU, how to view its details, and the syntax for more complex tasks.

## Saving Your Work

Please now open your jobs directories which you have created and copy them over to your `workdir` your created in the previous Exercise Sheet.

When you delete a job in the Job Composer - it wipes the directory, job script and all results contained within. This is why it is good to make a copy of scripts either in your home directory, or to make templates out of them!
